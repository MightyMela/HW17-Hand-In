                <h1> I'm engaged and enthused about the field of UX/UI Design. Everyone could use more ease and delight
                    in life!

                <br>
                <p>Transforming from being a small-retail business owner to the field of User Experience is a natural
                    step for
                    me. The importance of knowing your customer/user and anticipating their needs while providing
                    <strong>aesthetically pleasing, beautiful display</strong> and design was instilled in me early.
                    Balancing
                    the needs of the business with the wants and wishes of the consumer is a dance Iâ€™m well versed in.
                    <br>
                    I pride myself on my determination and adaptability. I love to collaborate, and create compelling
                    experiences that are enjoyable and approachable. The potential of improving lives is exciting and
                    truly
                    attainable in this field!
                    <br>
                    In my spare time I like to bake bread, read, play with my dog, and perhaps scroll through Tik-Tok or
                    stay in
                    touch with friends via the app Marco Polo
